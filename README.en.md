## Usage Notice

> [!CAUTION]
> Mumu is a local Windows learning-task client. Use it only with your own accounts or accounts you are explicitly authorized to manage.
>
> Do not use this project for commercial task farming, account resale, bypassing platform verification, data theft, or other unlawful activity. You are responsible for account restrictions, data loss, and legal consequences caused by use that violates school or platform rules.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mumu is not affiliated with or endorsed by Xuexitong, EduCoder, Zhihuishu, ICourse163, ICVE, ZJY, or Yuketang. Names and logos identify the connected services only.
>
> Platform pages and capabilities may change. Mumu does not guarantee support for every school, course, question type, or page version. Model requests send task context to the provider you configure. Confirm platform rules and data-handling requirements before use.

### Disclaimer

> This project is intended only for technical research and learning exchange. Do not use it in any scenario that violates platform rules, school regulations, or applicable laws and regulations. Users are responsible for the consequences of their use.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Accounts and platforms** | Save accounts by platform and stable user ID, sync names and avatars, update existing records after reauthorization, and never merge accounts by display name |
| **Assignments** | Collect unfinished and currently submittable work, identify question types, generate answers, fill deterministically, save drafts, evaluate, and verify submission |
| **Online courses** | Read courses and task points, skip completed content, run supported media and reading flows, and retain platform progress evidence |
| **Attendance** | Process multiple accounts in batches; support codes, gestures, QR codes, and location input, with revocable batch sharing links |
| **Live task browser** | Give every task an isolated browser and authorization snapshot; support live viewing, pause, retry, and manual intervention without stopping the task when a viewer closes |

Tasks run in separate browsers and may process different accounts in parallel. Mumu marks a task complete only after a verifiable platform result; model claims, screenshots, and partial completion are not treated as completion evidence.

## Getting Started

1. Download the Windows x64 installer from [Releases](https://github.com/ravicc02/Mumu/releases). Release candidates are marked as pre-releases.
2. On first launch, review the environment check. Install missing dependencies when available, or use the displayed manual command if installation fails.
3. Configure the model endpoint, API key, model, and reasoning effort, then authorize a platform account. Either step can be skipped and completed later in Settings.
4. Select a task to run. When Mumu requests intervention, use the original task browser to review the page, then continue.
5. Check the platform verification result. Final submission for Xuexitong and automatic evaluation for EduCoder are configured separately in assignment settings.

**Run From Source**

Supported environment: Windows 10/11 x64, Node.js 24, Python 3.13, and Chrome or Edge.

~~~powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
npm --prefix desktop ci
$env:MUMU_PYTHON = (Resolve-Path .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe).Path
npm start
~~~

To preview the web app, use two terminals:

~~~powershell
# Terminal 1: repository root
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe backend\run_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8877

# Terminal 2: repository root
npm run desktop:web
~~~

The frontend runs at http://127.0.0.1:5174/ and the local API at http://127.0.0.1:8877/. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and build instructions.

## Data and Privacy

The default data directory is `.mumu` under the user profile, for example `%USERPROFILE%/.mumu`, and stores authorization, tasks, SQLite data, and screenshots. On upgrade, Mumu copies the legacy `%LOCALAPPDATA%/AIAssistantStudio` directory into the new location without deleting the old data. Model requests send questions and necessary context to the model service configured by the user.

~~~

If a problem occurs, open the log directory from Settings and provide a redacted main.log. Public issues must not include cookies, API keys, QR credentials, or authorization files. See [Security](.github/SECURITY.md).
